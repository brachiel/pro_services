Pro services is a django app. That means if you want to use
pro services, you'll have to install a copy of django.
https://www.djangoproject.com/

After you installed django, you need to start a new project.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/tutorial01/

Copy the contents of the folder this INSTALL is in to your
django project and adapt your settings.py.
You need to adapt the INSTALL_APPS variable, and set

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'auth.hapi_auth.HAPIAuth',
)

and

AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'farm_mngr.HypUserProfile'

Of course you have to edit the most of the other variables
as well. Please read the django tutorial for details.

Other optional options:
LOGIN_URL = '/pro_services/user/login/'
